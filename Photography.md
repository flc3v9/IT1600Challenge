**Background**  
>As mentioned, I have been taking photographs for years. I started taking photos with my iPhone in middle school because I really liked the way the sunrise looked on my way to school. After taking photos for awhile, I was gifted a camera my sophomore year of high school. It was a [Nikon D3400](https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product-archive/dslr-cameras/d3400.html) my dad had bought during Black Friday.   

I used this camera a lot, especially since I was involved in clubs that had me take photos for them. The D3400 has its limitations for sure. This is very apparent when shooting sports in any lighting that was not daytime. The ISO range on the camera was fine, but anything higher than 400 introduced grain. After awhile, I realized that I needed to upgrade.  

I looked through various cameras, but I was particularly drawn to the Fujifilm series due to their filtering and color retention. I was also heavily inspired by a photographer on Instagram called [JetJaguar](https://www.instagram.com/jetjaguar/). I really loved the way his colors looked and how he was able to create both strong contrast and soft images with plenty of color. As such, I bought myself a [Fujifilm XT-3](https://fujifilm-x.com/global/products/cameras/x-t3/).

I used this camera a lot. It basically was used for most of my photography career in high school and college. It was not until this past winter that I bought the Fujifilm XT-5 because of the new, in body stabilization and the doubled megapixel sensor. By then, I already had quite a few lenses and was ready to go take photos. The XT-5 is the camera that took the Kamakura photo I showed on the home page.

**Scenery Camera Comparison**  
Here is a comparison of photos from each camera[^1]:

[^1]: The quality is hard to tell between the images because I screenshot them from my portfolio. The actual files would have been very large.
[^2]: I haven't taken portraits with the XT-5 yet, but that is also because I don't like portrait shoot as much as street photography. Also, I haven't had the time.


It is probably hard to tell the difference between them, and that is normal. The biggest difference for me is the quality of the photos and the amount of color and image manipulation I could do on each photo. For example, the D3400 photo was barely cropped in post-processing because it would look mildly grainy when you cropped. The other two photos are not cropped much, but they could be cropped much more than the D3400 photo. In the portrait photos, I was able to push the lighting on the XT-3 much more than the D3400, and I was able to pull off brigher colors without it looking as unnatural as the D3400 photo.

All in all, I really like photography. It is one of the things that make me happy. I always strive to edit one good photo from any shoot I do, no matter how uninspired I might be.
