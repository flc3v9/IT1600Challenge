For some background:

- I started drawing back in middle school, and this hobby has developed into painting, ink drawings, and sketches. 

- I started taking photos in middle school as well, but I did not get my first actual camera until sophomore year of high school. 

- I have never taken classes for either of these, so I am self taught. The most classes I have taken was when I took the photojournalism class to help out my high school journalism program.

- I originally majored in art, but I found that the academic procreess of art was not something that worked well with my creative process. 

When looking to create art, one of the biggest issues for me is finding inspiriation. This is one of the main reasons why I did not continue art school as I was unable to constantly or reliably be inspired to create. That said, after creating for about 10 years, I have come to learn what inspires me the most:

| Art | Photography |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Media, specifically movies | Surrounding area |
| Former interests of mine (ex. space) | People with me or around me | 
| Very specific images or ideas | Vague concepts | 
| Very rarely, an idea will come from just emotions|

For me, I think taking photos is easier than creating art. The main reason is because I do not visualize in my head very well, so I always have to rely on a visual aid when creating art. In photography, what you see in front of you is what you get. Yes, you can use Photoshop or AI tools to add in and change what is there, but most of my photography revolves around taking what I see and creating a mood that represents it. I have the most creative fun in post-processing because I get to work with colors and timing in the case of videos. I have also done other types of creative work, but I do not have as big of a body of work as I do for these two subjects. In my portfolio, I do have some links to some of the videos and graphic design I have done, but there is not a lot I like to display besides photography and art.
